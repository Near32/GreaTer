torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 3.80 GiB. GPU  has a total capacity of 79.14 GiB of which 3.08 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 37.32 GiB memory in use. Process 1811744 has 414.00 MiB memory in use. Process 2133266 has 38.31 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 34.22 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 2.61 GiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
