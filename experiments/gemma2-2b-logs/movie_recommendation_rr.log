torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 5.06 GiB. GPU  has a total capacity of 79.14 GiB of which 4.84 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 24.72 GiB memory in use. Process 4064864 has 414.00 MiB memory in use. Process 5097 has 49.15 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 23.92 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 314.38 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
